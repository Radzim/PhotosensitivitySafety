I want to create a project that will help people with photosensitive epilepsy navigate the internet safely.
Bright screens that display video content have the potential to cause seizures in people suffering from photosensitive epilepsy. The internet can be full of triggering and malicious content.
I would like to create a project that an end user could use to shield themselves from exposure to such content, both malicious and accidental. After consultations with my supervisor I decided that a web browser extension would be best suited for this task. The extension would analyse all videos embedded in the site (and potentially other dynamic elements), looking for specific patterns of blinks and flashes that occur at the frequency, brightness and size which could make them a trigger, and warn users of potential dangers.
